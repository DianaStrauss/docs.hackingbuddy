*Helping Ethical Hackers use LLMs in 50 Lines of Code or less..*

HackingBuddyGPT helps security researchers use LLMs to discover new attack vectors and save the world (or earn bug bounties) in 50 lines of code or less. In the long run, we hope to make the world a safer place by empowering security  professionals to get more hacking done by using AI. The more testing they can do, the safer all of us will get.

Start your own security research using LLMs! {% .lead %}

## Main Contributors

The project originally started with [Andreas](https://github.com/andreashappe) asking himself a the simple question during a rainy weekend: *Can LLMs be used to hack systems?* Initial results were promising (or disturbing, depends whom you ask) and led to the creation of our motley group of academics and professinal pen-testers at TU Wien's [IPA-Lab](https://ipa-lab.github.io/).
